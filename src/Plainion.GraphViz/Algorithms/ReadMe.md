- "Show" algorithms
  - ignores other masks when searching for relevant nodes
  - additive - behaves like "add"
- "Extract" algorithms
  - considers other masks when searching for relevant nodes
  - shows only nodes which fullfil the criteria in the currently visible path
  - negation of "
- "Hide" algorithms
  - ignores other masks when searching for relevant nodes
- "Remove" algorithms
  - considers other masks when searching for relevant nodes
  - hides nodes which fullfil the criteria in the currently visible graph
