  <Content><![CDATA[- we could actually create "dynamic" masks which save the e.g. regex pattern for the nodes that should be shown/hidden
- currently we dont want that for performance reasons
- BUT: we could define "mask templates" which store the pattern instead in case we later discover that we want to reuse 
  such settings/templates/masks across graphs of same type (e.g. dependencygraph of different tasks we always want to hide contexts)
