Sometimes quite some work on the graph is needed to finally be able to see what you were looking for.
You may need to create several filters and you may need to apply quite some clustering.

If you want to save your work for later just
- Click on the "Save" button in the toolbar
- Select "Plainion.GraphViz files (*.pgv)"
- Click "Save"

If you later want to resume your work you can 
- Either use the "Open" button from the toolbar and select again "Plainion.GraphViz files (*.pgv)"
- Or just drop the saved ".pgv" file onto the canvas
